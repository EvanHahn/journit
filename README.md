journit for OSX
===============

a random script that i needed as a companion for [journ](https://github.com/EvanHahn/journ)

i have this on my clipboard:

```
2015-01-23

dear diary:

today was rad
```

i run this:

```sh
./path/to/journit.sh
```

i get a file called `2015-01-23.txt` that contains this:

```
dear diary:

today was rad
```

only works on OSX for now

enjoy, friend
